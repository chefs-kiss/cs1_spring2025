The TAs are here to help guide you through the problem solving process, but are not responsible for giving exact answers to homework.\nTextbook: The textbook for this course is an online interactive textbook, available for free through Runestone Academy\nCourse Description: This course introduces the perspectives and methods of computer science. Students learn to develop algorithms, which are step-by-step procedures for accomplishing a task. Students translate these algorithms into a programming language, utilizing common programming structures. The structures covered include variables, functions, loops, control flow, basic data structures, classes, and a brief introduction to object-oriented programming.\nCourse Objectives: - To understand key concepts and abstractions involved in programming. - To be able to write simple computer programs. - To better understand how computers work. - To develop knowledge and skills that will allow the student to use computers to solve novel problems throughout life.",
